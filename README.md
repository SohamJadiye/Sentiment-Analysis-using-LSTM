# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM
In my sentiment analysis project on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, I employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify 50,000 reviews into positive and negative sentiments. The dataset was split into 40,000 reviews for training and 10,000 for testing. After preprocessing the text data, including tokenization and encoding, I designed the LSTM model with an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a dense output layer. During training, the model learned sequential patterns and relationships between words. Evaluation on the test set demonstrated the model's effectiveness, achieving high accuracy in classifying sentiments. This LSTM-based approach proved powerful in capturing the contextual nuances of movie reviews, providing a reliable method for automated sentiment analysis in the ever-expanding world of textual data.
